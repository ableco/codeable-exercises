I think people see me like a quiet person but I can be anxious in some cases, maybe when I worried about something or when I have high expectations about a certain situation, I can’t help it, I start overthinking about that topic.
---------
What drive me nuts is the traffic in my city,  is very stressful specially in rush hours, it can pass like
a half hour and you are in the same place.
---------
People can earn an extra gold with me if they keep their word, that’s is very  important for me because in that way I can trust them
---------
I think there isn’t a thing that I must clarify to people when they know me, maybe when I make a kind of joke, sometimes there is a person who misundertand what I say, so I have to explain what I meant.
---------
The best way the people can convince me to do something is being polite and offer something to me, it could be a favor for example.
---------
I would like to get a feedback if it is very honest and positive, so I can improve the things that they mentioned.
