haha it's curious that you use the word "honestly" although I can urdenstand the reason behind this. To answer to this, I am a competitive, LITERAL (I remark much that and if you are insteresting in why of that, ask me xP) person, have open mind since I can listen to they and talk with someone who talk me about anything which it can be since the most common thing to the craziest, although I can have a personal opinion because I have always tried to have an opinion about anything, I never think that something will be imposible. I have the same answer to do any activity.

To answer this question, I have to enphatise that it has two different meaning which is positive and negative, but I'll answer both.

In general, what drive me crazy, what I love is to be able to have fun to the fullest. If I can do some activity that made me feel a big intensity of fun, that would be my answer. Currently, I can group my answer to the following activiies: to travel with friends(preferably It is out of Lima), to play a videogame that catch my eye with much intensity and to do any sport.

On the other hand, about the negative, it is easy to me I can answer this, what I hate a lot from much time ago is the public transport	and the traffic.It's very easy understand them so it is not neccesary to write reasons. Out of that I don't have another thing more, I am impacient but it's less intense compared with them.

It's a good question, sinceresly sometimes it crossed my mind and I came the conclusion that things most important that they have to have to get the most of my truth is the iniciative to look for any way to help me at some point in my life. There is another way but it depend on the time I know them and they are honest themselves without care what others think.

Thanks for this question, do you ever ask me if someone would ever ask me this question? I have been considered a stubborn person (at times if I can give them the reason) when there is a discussion or difference of opinions or comments on a particular topic. But it is not that I do not hear other opinions or that I believe that I have absolute reason but that I hear a comment and I am interested in knowing the argument of it, as I consider myself logical and analytical, I put a lot of focus on it since If I consider that this argument does not have enough ground I do not consider it valid and therefore I am left with my own opinion, however when someone's argument based on a foundation that I consider valid is better than mine, I take your opinion as the correct or combine it with something of my own opinion. Although I am possibly to blame for that because I can not express well or my way of talking seems aggressive, I have tried to correct that now.

Here I must separate two areas, the professional, ethical and moral side, and all the rest. For the first I am a logical and analytical person, I am rarely risky, so depending on the fundamentals to carry out a project, I must evaluate it. For the second which I define in how I can be convinced to perform some activity, there if I can answer very probably yes, since I think it's fun to experience the different things that can be done in this life, for example about 3 years ago a friend told me we are going to do bungee jumping, and even though I said myself that I was insane, I said let's do it, and in the end I did it xD
---------
I prefer they tell me this the most sincere, sometimes raw, but always as much as possible FACE TO FACE. That in order that if there is something wrong that I did I would like to know what is in their perspective the things that I must take into account. I may sometimes consider some points of view more than others but I always try to do something by putting myself on the feet of the rest and see it from that side and if there is something that I am not taking into account, can solve it.
