It’s hard to answer this… well, Ceviche is one of my favorite foods and when  	I see it, I can’t avoid tasting it. Other thing it’s to play soccer, I love to play and I immediately run each time I see a soccer ball. I have played since I was a child and I’ve continued playing until now. My favorite soccer player is Ronaldinho. I think he showed me the soccer magician.

Coding. I believe people can work some projects with me and we can make a lot of money together.
