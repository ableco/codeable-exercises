# Week 3: Extended Project
## Web Server

Build a simple HTTP server in Ruby

## Instructions

- Download all files.
- In terminal, go to `\lib` folder and run `ruby logic.rb`
- Open your explorer and access http://localhost:8000

## Acceptance Criteria

- Your server needs to respond to GET requests
- Have an html homepage in `/` greeting the visitor and telling more about who is on your team and what is Codeable for you
- For any request not specified above search for a file with the same name as the path in `./public` and reply with the content (eg. `/hi.html` should reply with the content of `./public/hi.html`)
- For every member in your team, create a webpage displaying more information about you and serve it at `/?member=name` where `name` should be replaced by your team member's name.
